The effect of this hormonal response is an increase in the total blood volume. The increase in maximal oxygen consumption (vo 2max) with endurance training is associated with that of maximal cardiac output (q max), but not oxygen extraction, in young individuals.whether such a relationship is altered with ageing remains unclear.

<p>Endurance training decreases the risk of hypertension, stroke, chest pain, diabetes, and other associated diseases. Endurance training causes an increase in a few specific hormones that regulate the amount of blood in the body. Effective cardiac output (co) is an indicator for fitness (dimkpa, 2009).

<p>The effects of autonomic dysfunction and regular activity on the cardiovascular system were investigated. Uring a single bout of exercise of increasing intensity, it is generally acknowledged that heart rate (hr) and cardiac output (qc) increase in a near linear manner with increasing power outputs, whereas stroke volume (sv) tends to level off at between 40 and 60% of a person’s maximal oxygen uptake (o 2max).further, in response to endurance training, for the same absolute. Your goal should be to maintain a heart rate of 120 to 150 beats per minute. Effective cardiac output (co) is an indicator for fitness (dimkpa, 2009). Lesson 2 long term effects of exercise.</p>
