Should I Stretch Before Or After My Workout Complete Fitness Design From completefitnessdesign.com
I have gotten up at 4:30 am to workout, started to workout at 10:00 pm, done it at 2 in the afternoon. But for exercises lasting less than an hour, eating before or after the workout would not have much effect on performance. Right now i go immediately after work at 5:30. Tanning before working out is not only popular among beginners, but professional bodybuilders also avoid exercising after tanning.
