<p>Firstly, we need to define cardiorespiratory resistance. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) the manual application of chest compressions and ventilations to patients in cardiac arrest, done in an effort to maintain viability until advanced help arrives. The heart and lungs must adapt to be able to carry oxygenated blood to all of the body’s muscles. “cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability of your heart, blood vessels, and lungs to deliver oxygen to working muscles,” says trevor thieme, c.s.c.s., beachbody’s senior manager of fitness and nutrition content.

<p>Firstly, we need to define cardiorespiratory resistance. Maybe you know it simply as “endurance.” either way, it’s a skill that can improve your performance in just about any athletic endeavor, allowing you to exercise harder and longer — and reach your goals faster. Cardiorespiratory fitness is how well the body processes oxygen. It’s the ability that the body has to perform tasks that require a lot of movement or the input of large muscle groups for a long period of time. Cardiovascular System.</p>
