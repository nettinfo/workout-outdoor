<p>The maximal amount of physiological work that an individual can do as measured by oxygen consumption. “aerobic capacity is the maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilize during intense exercise,” explains trevor thieme, cscs, senior fitness. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. Aerobic activities they do not need a great physical effort, the most important thing is the duration of each one of them. Aerobic Capacity lesson 1.</p>

<p>Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are. The definition of aerobic capacity is the a measure of the ability of the heart and lungs to get oxygen to the muscles. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).
