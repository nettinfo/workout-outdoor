<p>Cardiac catheterization, also known as cardiac cath or heart catheterization, is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. Cardiac catheterization gives doctors important information about the heart muscle, heart valves. Cardiac catheter is a minimally invasive test that can be done before a cardiac procedure, catheterization of the heart, or cardiovascular disease treatment. (this procedure is called an âangiogram.â) if a blockage is detected, it can be opened through a procedure called âangioplastyâ or âstent Interventional and Structural Heart Disease Cardiovascular Division.</p>
