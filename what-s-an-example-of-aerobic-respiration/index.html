The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration. The respiration which uses oxygen is called aerobic respiration. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Aerobic respiration is the process of producing cellular energy involving oxygen.

<p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. It produces a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (atp), which exists in all living tissues.

It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp. The first step in is glycolysis, the second is the citric acid cycle and the third is the electron transport system. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Lab 7 BIOL 121 FALL 2020.</p>
