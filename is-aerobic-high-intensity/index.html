The aim of this study is, thus, to compare training methods of different intensity matched for energy consumption. Aerobic exercise provides a wide range of benefits for the body and brain. High intensity interval training (hiit) it is considered a complete workout that combines both aerobic and strength (resistance) training. VOmax defines the maxiumum aerobic work rate and is a good measure of.</p>

<p>Aerobic training is primarily done in low to moderate intensities and remains constant. Aerobic exercises like walking or jogging offer numerous health and cardiovascular benefits while anaerobic exercises such as a strength training routine or hiit routine generally allow for more efficient fat burning and muscle building.

<p>As already mentioned, the two most common training types are aerobic training and high intensity training or repeat anaerobic effort. High intensity interval training (hiit) it is considered a complete workout that combines both aerobic and strength (resistance) training. Anaerobic training effect uses heart rate and speed (or power) to determine how a workout affects your ability to perform at a very high intensity. If the intensity is too high, then the players will be unable to maintain a high enough work rate during subsequent work bouts and the desired effect of the aerobic hi training will be lost.
