The aerobic energy system works via the breakdown of carbohydrates by oxygen. This energy is stored in the muscle for use later when you need it most. The aerobic energy system uses oxygen to keep producing atp over a long period of time. The aerobic system’s endurance comes at the cost of power.

<p>Often referred to as the “energy currency” of biology, this molecule allows cells to turn energy into work. What is the aerobic energy system? This system is dependent upon oxygen to produce energy using blood glucose, stored glycogen in the muscle, and fat stores. Though, there are two ways this energy system can be used.</p>

<p>The anaerobic energy system is the energy system of choice for the 100m sprinter. This reaction produces the cellular energy required for the body to move.

<p>During aerobic (slow) glycolysis, glycogen is converted to glucose. Neither system provides sustainable energy for very long. And so, lactic acid is not as guilty of fatigue as people used to think. This pathway requires oxygen to produce atp, because carbohydrates and fats are only burned in the presence of oxygen.

<p>During aerobic (slow) glycolysis, glycogen is converted to glucose. This system is dependent on oxygen and while it's the slowest method for producing atp, it produces the biggest volume and is the system our body relies on for everyday processes.

<p>During aerobic (slow) glycolysis, glycogen is converted to glucose. However, when the intensity increases and the demands on the body change, the body must use other methods.

<p>Out of the three energy systems, it is the most complex. The aerobic energy system is used in conjunction with the metabolic system to provide you with all of the energy you need. The body uses carbohydrates and fats while producing energy using this method. The aerobic system uses aerobic glycolysis, the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain in its production of atp. Aerobic system.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-aerobic-energy-system">What Is The Aerobic Energy System?</h3><p>The aerobic energy system works via the breakdown of carbohydrates by oxygen. The work periods would usually exceed several minutes and the rest periods would be active but at a lower intensity that could be sustained. The more atp produced, the more energy is available. There are 3 energy systems used by your body and they all form atp which is an adenosine triphosphate chemical compound.</p>
<h3 id="aerobic-glycolysis-the-citric-acid-cycle-and-oxidative-phosphorylation">Aerobic Glycolysis, The Citric Acid Cycle, And Oxidative Phosphorylation.</h3><p>Our bodies can create anaerobic energy in two ways through the: And so, lactic acid is not as guilty of fatigue as people used to think. It becomes the dominant energy source after around 30 seconds of high intensity physical activity. In this first stage of aerobic metabolism, carbohydrates in the form of glycogen or glucose are broken.</p>
<h3 id="the-aerobic-systems-endurance-comes-at-the-cost-of-power">The Aerobic System’s Endurance Comes At The Cost Of Power.</h3><p>The third and final energy system which comes into play is the oxidative system, commonly known as the aerobic energy system. This energy system can be developed with various types of training. The root ‘aero’ means “relating to air,” in this case, we are referring to oxygen. The system uses fat as a fuel source, as well as sugars, and ends up providing around 90% of our daily energy.</p>
<h3 id="the-system-itself-can-be-divided-into-three-separate-processes">The System Itself Can Be Divided Into Three Separate Processes;</h3><p>It requires the heart, lungs and whole circulatory system to work. During aerobic (slow) glycolysis, glycogen is converted to glucose. Let’s start with the aerobic energy system, which provides the foundation for all activity. This fabulous system can literally fuel your movement for as long as you can stay awake in a day, yet this great capacity comes at a cost.</p>
