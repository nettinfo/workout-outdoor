30 Day Weight Loss Workout Challenge at Home Skinnyfitplan From skinnyfitplan.com
Halting a weightlifting program causes unfavorable detraining, or the loss of training adaptations such as enhanced strength or muscle size. Now if you stop exercising or going to gym your basal metabolic rate will decrease. Don’t stop the exercise, even if you can’t get down to a healthy weight. Exercise leads to higher metabolism, which decreases after stopping exercise, and the body uses less energy and starts converting the extra energy into fat.
