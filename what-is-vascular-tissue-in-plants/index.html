Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The stem of the plant is behind the derivation of the roots which are the group of simple tissues. These are components of the vascular tissue system in plants. Vascular plants have conducting, also referred to as vascular or liquefied, tissues that transport water, minerals, and photosynthetic materials throughout the plant’s roots, stems, and leaves.
